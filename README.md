# Life Is Full of Difficult Choices

_A playful interactive sketch by **Miffy** and **Mandy** exploring how conditional logic (if/else, boolean operators, state) leads to surprising consequences._

## Project Brief
Create a sketch that asks people to make difficult choices with unexpected outcomes. Use **conditional statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`), **boolean logic** (`&&`, `||`, `!`), and any other relevant programming concepts (state machines, timers, randomness, data structures) to control program flow and narrative branches.

### Core Goals
- Invite users to make a series of choices.
- Use branching logic to produce **surprising** and **meaningful** consequences.
- Make outcomes legible (visual/audio/text feedback) and replayable.
